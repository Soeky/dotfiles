# dotfiles

## Purpose 
This Repository contains my personal scripts and setup. I decided to start such a Repository, because I recently bought a new PC and was too lazy to setup all manualy. 
Most of the scripts etc are just for i3 and some pomodoro stuff just for now. 
If I can automate some tasks that I do more frequently I write scripts. 
Trying to be better at Bash.
